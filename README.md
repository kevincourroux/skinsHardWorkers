<a href="https://crafatar.com">Crafatar</a> serves Minecraft avatars based on the skin for use in external applications.
Inspired by <a href="https://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> (hence the name) and <a href="https://minotar.net">Minotar</a>.

Image manipulation is done by [lwip](https://github.com/EyalAr/lwip). 3D renders are created with [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) / [cairo](http://cairographics.org/).

# Installation

## Manual

- Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) 12 (LTS)
- Install `redis-server`
- Run `npm install`  
  If that fails, it's likely because because of `node-canvas` dependencies. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki#installation-guides) to install them.
- Run `npm start`

Crafatar is now available at http://0.0.0.0:3000.

## Docker

```sh
docker pull crafatar/crafatar
docker network create crafatar
docker run --net crafatar -d --name redis redis
docker run --net crafatar -v crafatar-images:/crafatar/images -e REDIS_URL=redis://redis -p 3000:3000 crafatar/crafatar
```

## Configration / Environment variables

See the `config.js` file.

# Operational notes

## inodes

Crafatar stores a lot of images on disk. For avatars, these are 8Ã—8 px PNG images with an average file size of \~90 bytes. This can lead to issues on file systems such as ext4, which (by default) has a bytes-per-inode ratio of 16Kb. With thousands of files with an average file size below this ratio, you will run out of available inodes before running out of disk space. (Note that this will still be reported as `ENOSPC: no space left on device`).

Consider using a different file system, changing the inode ratio, or deleting files before the inode limit is reached.

## disk space and memory usage

Eventually you will run out of disk space and/or redis will be out of memory. Make sure to delete image files and/or flush redis before this happens.

# Tests
```sh
npm test
```

If you want to debug failing tests:
```sh
# show logs during tests
env VERBOSE_TEST=true npm test
```

It can be helpful to monitor redis commands to debug caching errors:
```sh
redis-cli monitor
```
